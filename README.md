# tree_pruning
This project is for pruning the phylogenetic tree and output a clear one without extra leaves

To use this project, you just need to input the node.dmp file which you can download from:
http://linnaeus.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/tbmap/downloads/ncbi/ 

and you can find more information about the content of that file from here:
ftp://ftp.cbi.edu.cn/pub/biomirror/taxonomy/ncbi/taxdump_readme.txt

and Also, you should change the name of your input file which specify the UIDs that you are going to use in your program, and the output will be a pruned node with new indexers. Those new indexers are getting bigger by breadth first order.
